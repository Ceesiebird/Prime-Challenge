Prime-O-Tron README

Dear XITE,

I included this little readme as an explanation to the Prime-O-Tron I have built in response to your challenge.

Included in this folder you will find:

* 1 Prime-O-Tron HTML file (in which I also included the JS part of the Prime-O-Tron.)
* 1 Prime-O-Tron CSS file
* 3 relevant image files ;) (2 *.gifs and one *.png)

* A folder containing Jasmine unit test framework.(please open SpecRunner.html in this folder to execute the unit tests and view the result)
If you wish to see the workings of the unit test, please open the sub folder called spec and inspect PrimeNumberMachine.spec.js

* A text file containing UI tests to be manually executed for now,
 I had to choose not to automate these for now since I have to travel to Poland for my current assignment this afternoon and won't be back until the challenge window expired :(
 So I am in a terrible time crunch. (please don't hold it against me)
 If I wouldn't have had the trip to Poland on the agenda, I would have automated the UI tests using Selenium Webdriver combined with Cucumber. (just to explain my approach.)

* And this README file itself of course :)


I hope you like my response to your challenge, and I would love it if you picked me to join your creative team at XITE.

Kind regards,

Cees Vogel
